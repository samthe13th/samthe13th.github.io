    <h2 class="centered">The physics of asteroid impacts and exploding toasters</h2>
   <div class="centered"> <img src="assets/gifs/moon/moon_media/moon.gif"></div>
    <h4>

For a long time most geologists supported the theory that moon craters were actually calderas – the remnants of massive volcanos that had erupted and collapsed in on themselves. This would explain the often very uniform shape of moon craters. The competing theory at the time, was that the craters were caused by asteroid impacts, but this was often dismissed due to the fact that an impact from an object coming at an angle seemed unlikely to create a circular crater.
<br><br>
<h3>What do you think? Does this make sense?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Impact craters should be largely oblong, from angular strikes.</li>
<li>Yes.  Impact craters should be the same shape as the asteroid that made them (not usually round)</li>
<li>No. Impact craters should be circular due to the shockwaves of the impact.</li>
<li>No. Impact craters should be circular due to the speed at which asteroids ricochet off of the surface.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h4>
We now know that the majority of craters on the moon are caused by impact.
 It's tempting to think of meteor impacts like any other projectile hitting a surface - you could do a little experiment with flour and a rock and look at the "crater" formed. But as it turns out, this is a bad analogy for high-speed asteroid impacts.
<br><br>

A better analogy is this:

<br><br>
The reason craters are circular has to do with the way that the kinetic energy of the asteroid is being transformed.
An asteroid that strikes a moon or a planet like our own at high speed like 30,000 m per second has a massive amount of kinetic energy associated with it that is rapidly converted to thermal energy on impact.
<div class="eqn">Kinetic Energy --> Thermal Energy</div>
So what happens when the energy of an object is converted to thermal energy, aka HEAT, very quickly? It tends to explode. Or more specifically, it changes state to a gas very very quickly, which in turn expands, applying massive amount of pressure to everything in close proximity.
<br><br>
<h3>What do you always need for any explosion?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rapid transformation of some type of energy into heat</li>
<li>Nuclear energy</li>
<li>Chemical energy</li>
<li>Kinetic energy</li>
<li>Oxygen</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h4>
While most bombs rely on transforming the energy from chemical reactions into thermal energy, the reality is that that ANY type of energy that can be rapidly transformed into heat can cause an explosion, including kinetic energy. 
<br><br>
One definition of HEAT or THERMAL ENERGY is "A measure of the kinetic energy of individual molecules in an object".
<br><br>
In the case of a solid object like an asteroid, the motion of individual molecules is small in comparison to the speed of the object as a whole, and the energy of these molecules is smaller then the energy holding the asteroid together. During a collison though, the energy associated with the direction motion of the asteriod is converted into the motion of individual molecules. 
<br><br>
<h3>Remember, the conservation of energy tells us that the energy of a closed system is conserved, so the kinetic energy of an asteroid MUST get converted to another form of energy.</h3>
<br><br>
If the thermal energy resulting from imapct is greater then the energy holding the asteroid's molecules together as a solid object, then the object asteroid changes state, and it's molecules speed off in every direciton as a gas. THIS is why high speed asteroids mostly vaporize upon impact, resulting in a explosive shockwave.
<br><br>
The Earth has several examples of high-speed asteroid impact craters, the largest of which is believed to be from an asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs. 
The blast caused by this asteroid was the equivalent of over a billion nuclear bombs!

<h3>Which factor ALONE can predict the impact of an explosion caused by an asteroid?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The mass of the asteroid</li>
<li>The speed of the asteroid</li>
<li>The elemental makeup of the asteroid</li>
<li>The angle of strike</li>
<li>The kinetic energy of the asteroid on impact</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h4>
In the case of an asteroid impact, it’s the kinetic energy on impact that counts, not the mass or the speed of the impacter in isolation, but the combination of these two properties. 
<br><br>
One the most striking impact craters on earth is meteor crater in Arizona with a diameter of 1180 metres. 
<br><br>
<img src="assets/gifs/meteorcrater/meteorcrater_media/meteorcrater.gif">
<br><br>
The energy associated with the impact that caused this crater is estmated to be equiviant to detonating 10 megatons of TNT, or 4.1 x 10^16 J, and the asteriod that caused it is estimated to have been around 50 metres in diameter. But what if we hit the earth with something much smaller than this?
<br><br>
For the sake of a goofy thought experiment, let's imagine slamming a (very unthreatening) toaster into the earth.... 
<br><br>
<img src="assets/toaster.png" width="300px">
<br><br>
<h3>How fast would a 1 kg toaster have to move in order to make an impact crater the size of the one in Arizona? Remember that KE = 1/2 mv^2</h3>
<ul>
<li>59,600 m / s</li>
<li>106,000 m/s</li>
<li>44,540,000 m/s</li>
<li>289,274,955 m/s</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h4>
A 1 kg toaster would have to move at a monsterous speed of 289,274,955 m/s  (close to the speed of light!) in order to release that amount of energy. So that is rather unlikely. Further more, at that speed, it would explode on impact with the earth’s atmosphere, and no part of it would likely ever even reach the ground. But it’s still an interesting thought experiment. By the way, to make a dent the size of the crater that killed the dinosaurs, a toaster would have to move well past the speed of light, so we shouldn’t be too concerned with flying toasters ending civilization as we know it. 
<br><br>
In the next section, we will talk more about POWER – a measurement of the amount of work, or energy change over time. 
<div class="eqn">P = dE / dT</div>
The large amount of the power associated with an explosion is due to the short amount of time that energy is transformed. 
<br><br>
When you metabolize food - like chocolate cake say, some of the energy from the cake is tranformed into heat, but you don't explode (thankfully), because the speed at which your body does this is very slow in comparison to the speed at which energy is tranformed into heat in an explosion. 
<br><br>
<img src="assets/cake.jpg">
<br><br>
When we thnk about an action that has a lot of power, we usually mean that a lot of energy is being converted from one form to another in a relatively short period of time. Another way to say this is that a relatively large amount of WORK is done in a short period of time.
<br><br>
If there's one positive thing you can say extinction-event-causing asteroids, it's that they do a lot of work, and they do it FAST. Good job terrifying force of nature! Gold star.
