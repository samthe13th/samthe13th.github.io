    <h3>VIDEO INTRO TO KINEMATICS: DISPLACEMENT,DISTANCE,SPEED, and VELOCITY</h3>
    <p>My idea for this video is to film a UBC runner doing a 400m sprint on a track (one full circuit), and then talk to them about their speed and velocity afterword.<p>
    <h4>Example Script:</h4>
    <p>SAM: We're here at the UBC track with 400 m runner [name of runner]! So we are going to time you running around this track, and then talk about your speed and velocity. Sound good?</p>
    <br><p> ----------- film runner running down track, and then returning -------------- </p><br>
    <p>SAM: Great! Let's see how you did... so you ran 400m in [time of runner]. So your speed is 400m/time = [speed]. That's fast!. Do you have any idea what your velocity might be? </p>
    <p>So let's calculate your velocity.... so in physics, velocity is displacement over time, so to get your displacement, we need to look at your start and end positions. So you started here..... [show on track], and you ended.... here [same place]. So your displacement was zero metres! That means your velocity was.... 0 m/s. And it took you [runner's time] to do that? That seems very inefficent. Let me show you what I mean... I'll time myself [stand in one place and start and stop timer]. NICE! My displacement is the same as yours (0 meteres), but I got here in wayyyyy less time! </p>
    <p>So why is this?? Remember, that that displacement and velocity have directions. If you need help remembering the difference between displacement and distance, think of the word PLACE in displacement. Displacement is the spatial difference between two specific places, a start and and endpoint, and you need to travel in a specific direction from the start to the finish to get there. When we talk about velocity, we are talking about displacement over time. When we talk about speed, or average speed we are talking about distance traveled over time, in some unspecified direction.</p>

    <p>If we had done this same video with a 100m runner, the results would have been a bit difference, because their start and end point would not be the same. In fact their speed and velocity would be identical except for the fact that we specify a direction of motion for their velocity.</p>

    <h3>Vector Ball</h3>
    <p>Here's a rough demo (3 levels) for introducing students to vector addition with a little game! 
        <br> basically, you have to get the ball to the end by adding horizontal and vertical velocity vectors to it. When the ball runs over top of a vector pad, a velocity vector is added to the ball. Play around with it to see what I mean!
